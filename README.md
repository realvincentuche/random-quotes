## Getting Started with Random Quotes

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Source of quotes

Quotes are pulled from the [Quotable API](https://github.com/lukePeavey/quotable)

### Packages used

I used the axios package for api fetching, the dom-to-image package for converting the node element to an image, framer-motion for smooth animations and the sweetaleart2 package for showing errors in beautiful modals.

Feel free to use, share and drop any issues you notice. Will respond ASAP.
